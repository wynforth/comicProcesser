TO DO
- setting for how deep a folder structure to create default 2
- test if the files is an arhive before processing it
- option for not keeping a backup
- option for automode (quiet, no backup, recursive)
- option for superquiet mode (no output no logging)

BUGS TO FIX

USAGE
comicProcessor.sh [-opts] <item>

Processes comics so that it adds an icon to match (usually) the cover, but uses whatever the first image is.
Recompresses the files into both cbr, and cbz keeps the file with the smallest size
Sorts them into their respective folders based on:
Man Directory - <sub folder> - <extra stuff> #000.ext
Example:
file: X-Men - Legacy #465.cbz
would go to /X-Men/Legacy/X-Men - Legacy #465.cbz

if item is a directory will process all files in the directory, and sub directories
if item is a file will only process that single file


OPTIONS:
   -h, --help           Show the help message

   -d <path>, --topdir  Top path to where your comics are stored [Default: ~/Comics]

   -b <path>, --backup  Path to backup original file to. [Default: ~/Comics/Backup]

   --level, -l #        Depth level of folder structure created, use 0 for infinite. [Default: 2]

   --numbers, -n        Don't use # in parsing just use the last number in the filename

   --nonrecursive, -N   Does not recurse into subdirectories. This option is ignored if <item> is a file

   --interactive, -i    Interactive mode, will open folders and give you a pause to modify the files

   --verbose, -v        provides some extra information, eg ammount of space saved from original file, directory the final file is saved.

   --quiet, -q          Output is redirected a log file: comicProcessor.log. Can not be used with interactive mode

INTERACTIVE MODE:
	Using the -i or --interactive option this script will operate in interactive mode. After extracting a file the script will open the extracted directory and pause. At this time you can add/remove/edit files. Once you are done simply return to the script and press enter to continue. You will also be presented with the option to stop the script after each directory.
